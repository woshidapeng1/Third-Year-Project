Dataset reference: https://crawdad.org/thlab/sigcomm2009/20120715/ 

The dataset contains data collected by an opportunistic mobile social application, MobiClique. The application was used by 76 persons during SIGCOMM 2009 conference in Barcelona, Spain. The data sets include traces of Bluetooth device proximity, opportunistic message creation and dissemination, and the social profiles (friends and interests) of the participants.



By running the main.py file, you can get a diagram about the community of interest and friendship similarity.
You can edit the value of threshold to 0.5;0.6;0.7;0.8;0.9(Just like what the author of the original article did), then you got different data digrams.
